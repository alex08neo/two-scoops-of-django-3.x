## Before You Submit an Issue

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the issues from the previous version (1.11) [open](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/issues?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/issues?state=closed) to see if your issue already exists.
* Check the [changelog](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-3.x/blob/master/changelog.md) to see if your issue has already been resolved.
* Please, please, please identify each issue by chapter, section, and subsection numbers. Since the content shifts around using page numbers to identify problems is innaccurate.
* For tracking and credit purposes, **each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we may close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.**

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we may alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.
