## Before You Submit an Issue

* Be nice. :-)
* Be honest.
* Check the issues from the previous version (1.11) [open](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/issues?state=open) and [closed](https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.11/issues?state=closed) to see if your issue already exists.
* Check the [changelog](https://github.com/feldroy/two-scoops-of-django-3.x/blob/master/changelog.md) to see if your issue has already been resolved.
* Please, please, please identify each issue by chapter, section, and subsection numbers. Since the content shifts around using page numbers to identify problems is innaccurate.
* For tracking and credit purposes, **each request for correction needs to be in it's own issue. If an issue contains 2 or more issues, we may close it with a request for breaking up into more atomic issues.**

**Editorial Note:** In order to make issues more readily searchable, we may alter titles and descriptions of issues as needed.

## Sponsor Two Scoops of Django 3.x!

Two Scoops of Django is a huge effort of love. We're not just updating version numbers of packages, we're also validating every sentence and every code example in the book. We chop out the deprecated material and add in new material. We also work with security experts to validate our security material. All of this takes at least two months of full time work for both Daniel and Audrey. During that time we aren't consulting or working on products, instead we're digging deep into our hearts to deliver a body of work readers around the world can lean on.

If you want to help us, this time around we're taking sponsorship. We considered doing a Kickstarter or some alternative, but running a successful kickstarter takes at least a month of preperation. And honestly, we would rather spend that time and energy improving Two Scoops of Django. And that's why we're taking sponsorship.
